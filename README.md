**Guess the Number** game in C++ is a simple console-based game where the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess the number. After each guess, the computer provides feedback, telling the player if the guess was **too high**, **too low**, or **correct**. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

### Key Features:
1. The computer generates a random number.
2. The player inputs a guess.
3. The program gives hints (too high or too low).
4. The game ends when the correct number is guessed. 

This game helps in learning basic loops, conditionals, and random number generation in C++.
